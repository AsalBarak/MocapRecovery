# Robust and automatic MoCap data recovery (Matlab)

Matlab implementation of an original method for automatic and robust MoCap data recovery, based on a probabilistic averaging of different individual MoCap data recovery models.

This code requires the MoCap Toolbox for Matlab available at https://www.jyu.fi/hytk/fi/laitokset/mutku/en/research/materials/mocaptoolbox :

Burger, B. & Toiviainen, P. (2013). MoCap Toolbox â€“ A Matlab toolbox for computational analysis of movement data. In R. Bresin (Ed.), Proceedings of the 10th Sound and Music Computing Conference, (SMC). Stockholm, Sweden: KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

This repository also provides an extension to the MoCap Toolbox.

An article describing and validating this method is under submission (PLoS ONE). If accepted, the reference will be provided here, and should be used to cite this work.

Examples of MoCap data recovered with this method are displayed in the videos below (generated with the [MotionMachine](https://github.com/numediart/ofxMotionMachine)):
