# Robust and automatic MoCap data recovery (Matlab)

Matlab implementation of an original method for automatic and robust MoCap data recovery, based on a probabilistic averaging of different individual MoCap data recovery models.

This code requires the MoCap Toolbox for Matlab (Berger &amp; Toiviainen, University of Jyvaskyla: https://www.jyu.fi/hytk/fi/laitokset/mutku/en/research/materials/mocaptoolbox ).

This repository also provides an extension to the MoCap Toolbox.

An article describing and validating this method is under submission (PLoS ONE). If accepted, the reference will be provided here, and should be used to cite this work.
